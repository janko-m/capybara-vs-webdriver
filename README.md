# Capybara vs Webdriver.io

The goal of this project is to compare [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara)
of the Ruby world and Webdriver.io of the Node.js world. The purpose is to
prove that Webdriver.io is better, in order to reinforce my statement that all
frontend code should be written in JavaScript, so that everybody can just leave
me out of browser testing and let me do my Ruby APIs.

## Implementation

The project is split into challenges, and each challenge is composed of:

* HTML page which needs to be tested
* Capybara test for that HTML page
* Webdriver.io test for that HTML page

May the best browser testing library win!

## Dependencies

Othen than Ruby and Node.js, it requires PhantomJS to be installed.
